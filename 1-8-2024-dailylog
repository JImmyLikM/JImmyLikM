Today, I participated in a Zoom meeting to recognize six teachers. 
First, Gavin Liu, who is responsible for the Amazon technology education project, 
has been working for twenty years. Next, Jason Chen, who is an Amazon technology speaker,
has many years of cloud computing experience and is safely training background employees, will work for many top companies. 
Aimee Cao, who has 10 years of hiring experience,  has offered many people and is good at exploring talented people.
Also, you are the technology training and numeric learning project manager. 
Chen Hua, who is the new head supervisor, is responsible for the creativity idea progression of new innovation. 
Cynthina Zhang, who has 13 years of experience working in different areas of finance,  etc. The last one, 
Julian, who is training recognized for collaboration with Amazon, has 15 years of training experience. 
They talk about the purpose of boot camp and what they will teach us in the future. 
I can do online self-training and practice. The most important thing is that I have to apply for work after the Amazon exam. 
I am very excited to take part in this camp and learn more about generating AI for basic information. 
"Successfully cannot be left for practicing; skills and persistence are important, but there should be someone who gives you feedback and teaches you."
